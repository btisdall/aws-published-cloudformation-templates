# AWS-Published Cloudformation templates

AWS's CFN template repo doesn't contain all their published cfn templates, many of which are provided as resources on documentation pages and blogs. Plus, while providing templates is awesome many use JSON.

This repo collects AWS published templates I've found useful, with conversion to YAML where necessary.
